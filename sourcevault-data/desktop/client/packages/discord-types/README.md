# Discord Types

This package provides TypeScript types for the Webpack modules of Discord's web app.

While it was primarily created for Sincord based on Vencord and its respective packages, other client mods could also benefit from this, so it is published as a standalone package!

## Installation

```bash
npm install -D @sincord/discord-types
yarn add -D @sincord/discord-types
pnpm add -D @sincord/discord-types
```

## Example Usage

```ts
import type { UserStore } from "@sincord/discord-types";

const userStore: UserStore = findStore("UserStore"); // findStore is up to you to implement, this library only provides types and no runtime code
```

## Enums

This library also exports some const enums that you can use from Typescript code:

```ts
import { ApplicationCommandType } from "@sincord/discord-types/enums";

console.log(ApplicationCommandType.CHAT_INPUT); // 1
```
